"""
line_engine.py — Adaptive Line Builder

Groups ordered Words into Line objects using:
  - Adaptive Y-band tolerance: median_word_height * 0.70
    (NOT a fixed threshold — scales with font size per page)
  - Left-to-right word sort within each line
  - Line text = space-joined words

Adaptive tolerance means dense bank-statement fonts (height ~14px)
get a 10px band, while large header fonts (height ~40px) get a 28px
band — preventing both line collisions AND line splits.
